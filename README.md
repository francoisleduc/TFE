## General
This directory is dedicated to my master thesis on "Lambda functions for network control and monitoring". 

Until now you can find two folders 

```sh
/Protocol
```

and 

```sh
/XDP-Code 
```


The first one focuses on the development of a client-server protocol where the client wants to send events to the server, each with a unique identifier (lambda function identifier here). 

The second one focuses on a program that could count packets, bytes at a network interface in an efficient way in order to make decisions based on what is observed and captured at this interface (lambda functions/events trigger)
