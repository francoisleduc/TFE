## General
This folder is dedicated to the confection of a protocol to exchange lambda events (id) between switches and lambda servers. It is subdivided into two sub folders 

```sh
/netsimulation
```

and 

```sh
/src
```

both being pretty self explanatory

The first one is dedicated to testing the protocol and contains only the binaries of our mock server and mock client
The second one is the source code of the two mentionned.
